# Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Prediction-using-LSTM
This project explores stock data from the technology sector, focusing on companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Using `yfinance`, we retrieve historical data, visualize trends, analyze risk, and predict future prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

## Introduction
In this project, we work with stock market data, focusing on major tech companies (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft). Using `yfinance`, we gather historical stock data and perform data exploration, risk analysis, and stock price prediction using an LSTM model. Visualizations are created using `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` to help understand market trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis.
- **yfinance**: For fetching stock market data.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For visualizations.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Keras & TensorFlow**: For LSTM implementation.

## Dataset
We use historical stock market data pulled directly from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` Python library. The data includes daily stock prices and related information like adjusted close prices, volume, etc.

No separate dataset is required as the stock data is fetched in real-time during the execution of the notebook.

## Installation
Since this project is being run on Kaggle, the necessary libraries like `yfinance`, `Seaborn`, and `TensorFlow` should already be available.

If running this on your local environment, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install yfinance seaborn matplotlib tensorflow
